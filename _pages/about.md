I'm a third year graduate student from University of Science and Technology of China. My research interest includes computer vision, especially in the field of  Medical Image Processing, Semantic Segmentation and Generation Model.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Han from Northwestern Polytechnical University.
