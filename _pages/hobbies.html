I don't know how to import the posts from the _hobbies folder, so I'm just going to copy the code from year-archive.html and change the variables. But failes. I don't know why.

{% include base_path %}

{% for post in site.hobbies %}
  {% capture post.title %}{title}{% endcapture %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %}
